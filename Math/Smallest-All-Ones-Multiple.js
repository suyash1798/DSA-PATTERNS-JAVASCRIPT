/*

You are given a positive integer k.

Find the smallest integer n divisible by k that consists of only the digit 1 in its decimal representation (e.g., 1, 11, 111, ...).

Return an integer denoting the number of digits in the decimal representation of n. If no such n exists, return -1.

 

Example 1:

Input: k = 3

Output: 3

Explanation:

n = 111 because 111 is divisible by 3, but 1 and 11 are not. The length of n = 111 is 3.

Example 2:

Input: k = 7

Output: 6

Explanation:

n = 111111. The length of n = 111111 is 6.

Example 3:

Input: k = 2

Output: -1

Explanation:

There does not exist a valid n that is a multiple of 2.

 

Constraints:

2 <= k <= 105
