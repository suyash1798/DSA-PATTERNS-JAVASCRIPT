/*
Given the root of a perfect binary tree, reverse the node values at each odd level of the tree.

For example, suppose the node values at level 3 are [2,1,3,4,7,11,29,18], then it should become [18,29,11,7,4,3,1,2].
Return the root of the reversed tree.

A binary tree is perfect if all parent nodes have two children and all leaves are on the same level.

The level of a node is the number of edges along the path between it and the root node.

Example 1:

Input: root = [2,3,5,8,13,21,34]
Output: [2,5,3,8,13,21,34]
Explanation: 
The tree has only one odd level.
The nodes at level 1 are 3, 5 respectively, which are reversed and become 5, 3.
